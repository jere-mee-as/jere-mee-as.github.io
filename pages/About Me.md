## What is this?
Welcome to my public digital brain. Think of this as a wiki of things I would like to share. My blog [The Jereain Times](https://lesymboliste.substack.com/) is more measured, but usually there is more that I want to share to other people. Think of this as a repository of things that I find interesting.

- ## About Me
  collapsed:: true
	- My name is Jeremias "Jere" Sur. Here I am:
	- ![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87f8cf90-077d-4cab-af9e-ff45f6d23a86_2912x1638.jpeg)
	- I've had many different phases and interests in my life, though the main ones are:
		- [[Philosophy]]
		- [[Politics]]
		- [[Economics]]
		  (PPE)
	- I'm also interested in [[Art]], though that's taken a back seat for now.
	- My interests in the PPE started where I went to college, [[George Mason University]]. I've always been interested in counter-intuitive, unpopular views and, thankfully, GMU helped with that, especially their economics department. My main mantras,
		- [[Jere's Two Laws]] :
			- **If it's a popular belief, it's probably wrong.**
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- **Beliefs that feel good are probably definitely wrong.**
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number

- ## Where I'm Going
	- To my everlasting chagrin, I am one of the many young people today [growing up slower than previous people my age](https://www.srcd.org/news/teens-are-growing-more-slowly-today-they-did-past-decades) (I'm 26). Never the less, things are becoming more clearer.
	- For now, I am an office manager for the financial advising firm [Cresset Capital](https://cressetcapital.com/).
