- “No one should be making less than $70,000 while others are making $300 billion! This is what happens in Capitalism! If we apply socialist policies (redistribution of wealth, etc.) then we’ll prevent this!”
  
  Now, arguing against this should start with:
- collapsed:: true
  
  Explain Why Socialism is Bad
	- Socialism prevents economic growth and everyone turns equally poor. Now, the socialists in this country had the same desires as you do. They want fairness, equality, good standards of living. THEY HAVE BROUGHT THE OPPOSITE.
	- This is to say, do not let them think that socialism is attractive on net.
	- The best way to do this is to bring up the effects that socialism have brought to certain countries. Argentina had socialism. Huge amount of social servants, rent control, redistribution of income, and everything else. Now that those things are being cut, the country is finally breathing again.
	- Also, compare the standard of living of your grandparents to you. You are living like a king, and so is everyone else. So lets be really clear, capitalism causes economic growth and economic growth makes ==everyone== better off.
	- After this is established, they will likely say “Ok, ==some== capitalism is good, but everything in moderation. We are not moderately in capitalism, but ==too much in capitalism==.
	  
	  But first:
- The Poor get poorer with Socialism
  collapsed:: true
	- Capitalism has been better for the poor than socialism has.
	- collapsed:: true
	  
	  But then they’ll say:
		- ==Ok, that might be the case with extremes. But what we see now are a lot of poor people while the rich get richer and it shouldn’t be that way. We have people living paycheck to paycheck, huge amounts of debt, huge prices for housing, education, and healthcare.==
		- Lets go with these one by one:
	- collapsed:: true
	  
	  The Poor Get Poorer
		- There are many people living paycheck to paycheck. This is true, and life would certainly be better for them if they had more money.
		- Here's the thing: in free market capitalism, that person has access to better jobs, a better quality of life, and greater upward mobility. Compare that to the socialist countries where you are stuck where you are forever.
		- Also, what makes certain things so expensive is government controls and regulation.
	- collapsed:: true
	  
	  Housing Prices
		- A *huge* reason why housing prices are so high is *because* of government intervention through regulations and rent controls. That's right, you heard me quite clearly: the housing regulations and rent controls that are put in place HURT the people they are supposed to help. Now, not all regulations are bad, but there are ones like zoning and height limits that prevent more housing from being built. If, rather than having these government policies put in place, we would allow builders to build build build, we'd have so much more housing.
	- collapsed:: true
	  
	  Education Prices
		- College costs so much because the government ensures that loans will both be given and paid for by the students in the future. Lets put it like this: I want a loan for 1 million dollars, but the bank knows I won't be able to pay. So they don't give me the loan. But what if the government came in and said: "They will not be able to forfeit the loan"? Then loaners are more willing to loan it. Since the college degree is a good that people want, more people will not get it because the barrier to entry is lower. The universities realize that since there are so many students coming in, they can raise prices. The loaners don't care because the loans are ensured by the government. And the kids don't care because a) the degrees are valuable and b) they don't have to pay now but in the future. The result is higher prices that aren't felt now, but keep you in the hole later.
		- Anyways, the education system is fucked for more reasons than one. It'd be great if it costed less, however, the effects of the government would depend on the policy
			- Price Ceiling
				- First off, less people would go to college and colleges would get worse. First, the amenities and then the administrations would be culled. Professors would be paid less and, therefore, the real smart people would do something else that pays them more so education would get worse. Humanities and things like philosophy would get cut too because the academic returns don't justify the same costs. Since prices would be lower, more students would want to go and therefore be denied.
			- Govt paying for it
				- Short term, it'd be super fun and cool. Many more students would go than before, and they'd enjoy it because it's free for them. They wouldn't have the debt and would just have the benefit of a degree.
				- Long term, universities would raise their prices as high as they can and not be efficient at all because, since the government will pay for it, they can do whatever they want. There's no pressure to keep tuition low. So it'd be like government ensured loans, but worse. Difference is that now the tax payers are covering it.
				- Also, degree inflation would increase by 2,000% making a degree useless. You'd have cab drivers with bachelor's degrees. That's waste for the tax payers in that case. In that case, you'd need a graduate degree which would supplant the bachelor's. Only difference is that now the tax payer is paying for that misallocation of resources.
				- Scandinavian countries have free college, but they are waaaaaaay more selective as to who gets a degree. Also funding is limited.
				- So if free college were a thing, you'd have way more students getting more way useless degrees, and generally a worse education. Welcome to hell!

	  Healthcare Pricing
		- Healthcare costs so much for similar reasons as education. The issue is insurance companies essentially paying for you, which then makes you not affected by price. Since insurance covers it, you won't care about the price.
		- During WWII, government policies made employers give benefit of insurance. And that started the insurance debacle. So then people stopped being price savvy.
		- Medicare and Medicaid came in and did the same issue that free college would do. Costs became higher because they charged higher. Then the programs started underpaying to the providers, so the private insurance guys got the bill.
		- the ACA made things worse as well. if insurance has to cover more things, then it has to raise premiums.
		- Also health regulations drive up price as well. Also strict licensing laws. These things reduces supply and are stupid.

	  Wages are too low
		- So wages are low relative to the cost of goods. Capitalism is the best ever at lowering the cost of goods. thats number one. So if you want people to get better goods, you should let the market do its thing with innovation and lowering costs. This will do exactly what you want.
		- But ok, what if we raised minimum wages?
			- Easy: price hikes and increased unemployment.
				- If an employer has to pay his workers more, he will either make his workers work harder, or he'll increase prices. If he increases prices, that means the consumers will either have less goods or less money. So it hurts the common person still.
				- Unemployment also increases, simply because some jobs produce less value than the minimum wage requires. In other words, it will just be cheaper for the business (who may be struggling) to fire the worker.
				- Minimum wage also hurts the young and minorities. If a business has to pay a higher wage, the business will invest in "sure bets" because the "not so sure bets" will waste their money--moreover, since the wages are higher, they will attract older people. The result is older people being hired for jobs meant for 14 year olds. Minorities do worse because, since the wages are higher and there are less positions available, the managers can be a lot choosier. And people tend to hire those they are most comfortable with.
				- Lastly, minimum wage increases the incentives for automation because machines don't need salaries.
		- Don't forget welfare traps!
			- They're a thing.
		- Uhhhh ok what about UBI?
			- Better than everything else because it removes beaurocracy and is simple. Also, if autmation actually destroys all jobs and nothing is replaced (unlikely, though more likely if minimum wage is so high!), then maybe you could make the case for it.
			- However, realistically, UBI has a ginourmous thorn in its side: PRICE INFLATION.
				- Which could lead to a recession.
	- The billionaire problem
		- "There shouldn't be any billionaires"
		- My response:
			- Billionaires become billionaires by creating goods and services that everyone benefits from. They start as entrepreneurs with ideas and we all learn that we actually need that thing they just made! So we get it, it vastly improves our life and we are better off. Not just that, but the innovation of entrepreneurs makes other things more efficient which increases the quality of life for everyone. If, instead, we punish billionaires for being billionaires, we'll have less billionaires for two reasons:
				- They'll move. If they move, that will lower gdp and therefore the money of everyone in the country. Also social spending will move towards the common person.
				- There'll be less entrepreneurs. If we don't reward innovation with becoming rich, why would people risk their whole lives for a dream?
			- Billionaires can afford to take big risks. This is what venture capital is all about. Less billionaires = less risk taking = less innovation = stagnant economy = stagnant life. More investment in entrepreneurs = new jobs!
			- Billionaires invest, and also save money. Saving money in a bank = allowing individuals to get needed loans, etc. And if they spend their money, they're giving it to others by buying their products and services which make the producers better off (and the workers of the producers).
			- Also, I want to have a lot of money.
			- Less billionaires = worse for the poor. Who hires people? Who invests? Who creates amazingly good products that everyone benefits from?
- The moral of the story: these policies were put in to help all these people. And instead they increased prices, increased opacity, made consumers dumber, and all the rest. Ahhhhh!
- And the solution that people usually have is to add *more* government and *more* socialism!!!
  collapsed:: true
	- Metaphor: it's basically like bloodletting. you start bloodletting in order to make the patient better. But then they get worse and you think "oh man, we have to bloodlet *more*!
- **But of course, all of this is missing the point.**
  collapsed:: true
	- It's easy to give economic reasons, but that doesn't address their fear and worry and personal situation. So we have to bring it down to earth. Less billionaires would make you worse off. More income redistribution might feel good in the short term, but it would be bad for everyone in the long term.
	- My solution is that instead of raising taxes, we lower regulation and lower taxation (we actually can't do the latter because of the deficit but...)
	- collapsed:: true
	  
	  Also, we have to remember that these things have been tried before and they *didn't work*. For the most part.
		- (back of the envelope:) Sure, you have countries like Sweden. But two things: their taxes are really high for the working class because they realized that if they tax the rich too much, they'll leave. Also, their economy is stagnating, and if that continues, their welfare system wouldn't be sustainable.
	- Lastly, the issues you face in the economy today are not because capitalism is bad. But for the problems above which we blame the government on. These programs were put in for good intentions to relieve stress of people. And they just made the problem way worse.
	- This is why I say: bring in more capitalism! Because it's socialism which is making us starve. And has made countless people starve in the past!
	- **in short:** understand that the issue is very moral and very emotional and also very personal. And then show them how it actually wouldn't solve *their* problem.
